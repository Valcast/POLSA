# 🪐 POLSA
POLSA is my first "official" website that showcases the technological achievements of the company of the same name in the field of aerospace.

  
  
## 💻 TECH STACK 

I decided to limit myself to using only React and vanilla the rest because I wanted to focus mainly on honing my skills in REACT without using some complicated tech stack. Since this is my first "official" project on Github I wanted to start with the bare minimum and expand my tech stack as new projects emerge.

* HTML
* Javascript - React
* Vanilla CSS
* Bundler - Parcel
* Linter - ESLint
* Code Formatter - Prettier
